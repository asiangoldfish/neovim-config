# Configs

The (poorly named) <i>neovim-config</i> project is a collection of my personal
dotfiles and scripts. It also contains post-installation scripts that I use
to quickly get new systems running.

## Compabilitity
My dotfiles and scripts are intended for Linux systems. I am currently running [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), although I change disto from time to time. Currently, this repository is maintained for the following distros:

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/download)

The dotfiles and scripts still work for other distributions, and even other operating systems! Use them and change them to your heart's content.

# Legal
While the [MIT license](./LICENSE) is permissive, products using this project are required to contain it.

# Roadmap
- Install [openconnect-sso](https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso) to Debian
