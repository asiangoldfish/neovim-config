## Configuration file for Arch Linux.

## This is sourced as a regular identifiers. Therefore, variables and comments
## are recognised as usual.

## Convention:
##   - CAPITALIZED VARIABLES are recognised by the post-installation script.
##   - Lower-case variables are your custom variables.

# Both regular and AUR packages are supported. Note that Arch is a rolling
# release distribution, meaning an unmaintained 'arch_config.conf' may contain
# non-existant packages.
